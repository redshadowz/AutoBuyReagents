# AutoBuyReagents
This is a very simple reagent restocking addon. When you visit a merchant, you will see a small red button titled "ABR". That will display the Auto Buy Reagents options window.  

The window will be populated with reagents based on what spells you know and what level you are. You simply Input the number of reagents you want to buy, click the checkbox, and the addon will buy them automatically when you visit a merchant who sells that reagent.
