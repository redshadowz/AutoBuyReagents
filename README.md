# AutoBuyReagents
This is a small mod to a very simple reagent restocking addon. When you visit a merchant, you will see a small red button titled "ABR". Clicking it opens the Auto Buy Reagents options window.  

The window will be populated with reagents based on what spells you know and what level you are. Set the number of reagents you want to buy, click the checkbox, and the addon will buy them automatically when you visit a merchant who sells that reagent.
