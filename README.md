# AutoBuyReagents
This is a very simple reagent restocking addon. When you visit a merchant, you will see a small red button titled "ABR". This displays the Auto Buy Reagents options window.  
This window will be populated with relevant reagents based on what spells you know and what level you are. Input the number of reagents you want to buy and the addon will buy them automatically when you visit a merchant who sells reagents.
